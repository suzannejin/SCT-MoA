Datasets:
    (1) 43 datasets -> already preprocessed and filtered using the scripts in R folder:
            - GEO and 10X Genomics datasets: exclude genes with 0 in >= 95% samples
            - mousebrain.org datasets: include only the 2001 genes expressed in the largest number of cells
    (2) In order to use these datasets for the main analysis, the GEO datasets should be further filtered, 
        by excluding the genes with 0 in >= 80% samples


You can find the additional information of these datasets in:
- one-dataset-per-publication.txt
    Cells, genes and dropout of the further filtered (described above) datasets
    Information related to the study: PMID, year of publication, specie, sequencing protocol
    The kind of expression values (counts, rpkm, fpkm, tpm, ...)
    Cell type information
    Study conditions
- info1.csv
    Information (cells, genes, dropout) related to the datasets filtered at step (1)
- info80.csv
    Information (cells, genes, dropout) related to the datasets further filtered at step (2)
